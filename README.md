# spotify-api
Creates Spotify API Song Tracker that allows the user to see an artists popular songs, related artists, as well as create a playlist on their account based on selected songs.

.env file that is left out for security reasons contains the Spotify CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET that are required for formatting and creating the spotify authorization token

users_saved_songs.csv file is created once a user inputs and saves names of songs

post_client is still a work in progress as there are complications with user scopes and authorization requests that are preventing me from creating playlists and adding tracks to playlists on a user's Spotify account
